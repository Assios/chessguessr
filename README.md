Chessguessr is a game where you try to guess the next moves in a chessgame. All positions are currently taken from games played on [Lichess](https://lichess.org).

## Rules

Like Wordle, or Chessle, you are given hints after each guess.

- ðŸŸ© indicates that the move is correct.
- ðŸŸ¨ indicates that the move is correct, but in the wrong place.
- ðŸŸ¥ indicates that the correct piece type was moved (but not necessarily the exact same piece).
- â¬œ indicates that the move is wrong.

## Development

Chessguessr is built with [Remix](https://remix.run/), Typescript, Tailwind, Firebase (for keeping track of puzzle stats).
